# Predict-Happiness

This is my final project as a Break Through Tech AI Fellow at Cornell Tech, applying the skills I learned in their machine learning workshop this summer, including problem definition, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, feature enginering, model selection, feature selection, and model optimization.

I worked with the 2028 World Happiness Report (WHR) data set. I used a Decision Tree model to predict Life Ladder (happiness score) using various features including life expectancy, democratic quality, and more.
